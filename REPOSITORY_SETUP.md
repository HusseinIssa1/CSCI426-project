# Repository Setup - Choose Your Option

Since `csci426-project1` already exists, here are your options:

## Option 1: Use a Different Name (Easiest) ✅

I've updated your `package.json` to use `phone-seller-app` instead.

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `phone-seller-app`
3. Make it **Public**
4. Don't initialize with anything
5. Create repository

Then run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/HusseinIssa1/phone-seller-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

Your site will be at: **https://HusseinIssa1.github.io/phone-seller-app**

## Option 2: Use the Existing Repository

If you want to use the existing `csci426-project1`:

1. Go to: https://github.com/HusseinIssa1?tab=repositories
2. Find `csci426-project1` and click on it
3. Copy the exact URL from the browser
4. Tell me the exact URL, and I'll update everything

## Option 3: Delete and Recreate

If the existing repository is empty or you don't need it:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Settings → Scroll down → Delete this repository
3. Then create a new one with the same name

## Which option do you prefer?

Let me know and I'll help you complete the setup!
